# Supabase Schema Diagram

This diagram packages the current database thinking into a visual format so you can double-check relationships before touching the Supabase GUI. Because this project doubles as a learning sandbox, the annotations explain why each entity exists and how the arrows reflect the foreign key rules captured in `supabase/schema.sql`.

```mermaid
%% This ER diagram mirrors supabase/schema.sql and CURRENT_TASK.md so reviewers can validate relationships quickly.

## How to view the diagram
- **VS Code preview (recommended):** Open this Markdown file and use the built-in preview or the Mermaid extension to render the graphic locallyâ€”no browser navigation required.
- **Mermaid Live Editor (optional GUI):** If you want to tweak or experiment interactively, copy the fenced block into [https://mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live). This is the only time a browser UI becomes useful.
- **CLI-only inspection:** If you need to stick to the terminal, the Mermaid syntax is intentionally readable so you can still reason about the entity relationships without rendering.

Keep this file updated whenever the SQL or schema plan evolves so the visual stays in sync with reality.
