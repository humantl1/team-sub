# Agent Notes

## Latest Work Summary
- Activated the testing task in `CHECKLIST.md` so the project plan reflects our current focus and closed the loop once the setup was stable.
- Installed Vitest, Testing Library, and jsdom via pnpm, documenting the required sandbox approvals (`allow-scripts`, `allowedBuiltDependencies`) so esbuild can fetch its binary without interactive prompts.
- Added `vitest.config.ts` with detailed comments, switched the pool to `threads` to sidestep the CLIâ€™s process-isolation limits, and created `src/test/setup.ts` for shared matcher registration.
- Introduced a minimal `src/App.test.tsx` smoke test to prove the harness works end-to-end and updated the tsconfigs plus package scripts (`test`, `check`) so TypeScript and CI now understand the testing context.
- Ran `pnpm test run` to confirm the tooling passes in CI mode and moved the Vitest setup item into the completed section of `CHECKLIST.md` for visibility.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Ensure the testing suite is valid and working
2. I'm concerned with the our directory structure. We need to consider and discuss doing things such as separating testing, configs, etc. Consider professional practices while considering this.
3. If directory structure is changed, retest TypeScript config, linting, and testing to ensure nothing was adversely effected.
4. Pick up the Tailwind task from `CHECKLIST.md`: install Tailwind/PostCSS, scaffold `src/styles/tailwind.css`, and wire the import in `src/main.tsx` with the usual explanatory comments.
5. Once styling is in place, start shaping the app shell (router/providers layout) so future feature slices have a home.
6. Capture the pnpm/esbuild/threads learnings in `AGENTS.md` or a README snippet to prevent future sandbox friction.
