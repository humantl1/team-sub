# Agent Notes

## Latest Work Summary
- Hardened TypeScript configs across app and tooling to match the strict baseline: added `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, and the `@/*` path alias in `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, and `tsconfig.node.json` while documenting the rationale with inline comments.
- Installed and configured ESLint 9 flat-config stack with TypeScript, React hooks, React Refresh, jsx-a11y (converted to flat-compatible form), and Prettier compatibility. Added verbose comments explaining each layer.
- Added a shared Prettier configuration and exposed `pnpm lint` / `pnpm format` scripts. Verified lint passes after the new setup.
- Updated `CHECKLIST.md` to reflect the completed TypeScript and linting milestones so progress remains visible to the next agent.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Activate the “Set up Vitest + Testing Library environment” task in `CHECKLIST.md` and bootstrap Vitest, Testing Library, and a `src/test/setup.ts` file per AGENTS.md.
2. After testing dependencies, wire `vitest.config.ts` and add `pnpm test` / `pnpm check` scripts (`check` should run lint, test in CI mode, then `tsc --noEmit`).
3. Run `pnpm test -- --run` (or similar) to validate the new harness and record the checklist update.
